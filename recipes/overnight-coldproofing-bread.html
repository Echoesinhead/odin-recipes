    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I’m not going to kid you, this makes a very
        rich, moist chocolate cake recipe. So if 
        you are a faint of heart chocolate cake person, 
        this is not the cake for you.</p>
    <p>Based on the Old Fashioned Hershey’s recipe, 
        I sort of went a bit heavy-handed with some 
        changes testing cake after cake until I got 
        it just the way I wanted it, but the end 
        result was oh so worth it. The crumbs left 
        on the plate gave that away.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>300g flour</li>
        <li>100g starter</li>
        <li>200g water, cold</li>
        <li>5g salt</li>
        <li>1% of the total weight of olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix everything in a bowl. Don't oversteer</li>
        <li>Cover the dough and place it in the fridge overnight</li>
        <li>Take the dough and fold it a few times</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the ratan bowl with the flour and move the dough into the bowl, sprinkle it with the flour as well.</li>
        <li>Let it sit for 1 hour</li>
        <li>Gently move the dough to the dutch oven</li>
        <li>Preheat oven for 230c</li>
        <li>When the oven is heated place a metalic bowl with hot water on the lower deck of the oven.</li>
        <li>Put the dutch oven into the oven and bake it for 45 minutes with the lid on</li>
        <li>Remove the lid and bake for additional 5-10 minutes or until desired crust color.</li>
        <li>Remove the bread from the oven and cover it in the towel for additional 1 hour to finish the baking process</li>
    </ol>

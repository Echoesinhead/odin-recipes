        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I’m not going to kid you, this makes a very
             rich, moist chocolate cake recipe. So if 
             you are a faint of heart chocolate cake person, 
             this is not the cake for you.</p>
        <p>Based on the Old Fashioned Hershey’s recipe, 
            I sort of went a bit heavy-handed with some 
            changes testing cake after cake until I got 
            it just the way I wanted it, but the end 
            result was oh so worth it. The crumbs left 
            on the plate gave that away.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>300g Flour</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>200ml milk</li>
            <li>100g Cocoa powder</li>
            <li>7g baking powder</li>
            <li>1 pinch of love</li>
            <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
            <li>2 pinches of cringe</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 350f</li>
            <li>Mix dry ingredients together in a bowl</li>
            <li>Mix wet ingredients together in another bowl</li>
            <li>Slowly add wet mixture to dry ingredients. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into the baking pan</li>
            <li>Bake for 50 minutes until brown</li>
            <li>Check with the wooden toothpick. It must come out dry.</li>
        </ol>

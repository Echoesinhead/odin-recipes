        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I’m not going to kid you, this makes a very
             rich, moist chocolate cake recipe. So if 
             you are a faint of heart chocolate cake person, 
             this is not the cake for you.</p>
        <p>Based on the Old Fashioned Hershey’s recipe, 
            I sort of went a bit heavy-handed with some 
            changes testing cake after cake until I got 
            it just the way I wanted it, but the end 
            result was oh so worth it. The crumbs left 
            on the plate gave that away.</p>
